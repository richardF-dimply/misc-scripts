# misc-scripts

Once you've cloned the repo or copied and created a version on your own machine you will need to edit the script file (.sh) to allow it to be executed. You read how to do this here https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/terminal/apdd100908f-06b3-4e63-8a87-32e71241bab4/mac) 

Once you've made it editable you can run it in the terminal using the following command 

> ./YourScriptName.sh
